This is the warm-up exercise of CS598G Embedded System, at Hood College in Frederick MD, Spring 2017.

The code is an adatation of Alex Bradbury & Ben Everard's 
chapter5-platformer.py code, provided for use with their book:
Learning Python with Rasphberry Pi:
The text is original code is available for download at:

This program was made for an assingmnet wherein we were required to make changes
to the original code: these changes are detailed below:

1) multiple levels, the code was adataped to support additional levels, and currently now 
has 2 instead of just 1.

2) pausing, the code has been updated to support pausing the game by pressing the 'p' button
and resuming by pressing the 'c' button.

3) invincibility buttons: buttons have been added to the game, and when the player steps one,
they become invincible to the falling fireballs for a duration of time.

4) images, the fireballs have been animated so they cycle through multiple images and appear to flicker,
 lidia (the player character) when invincible changes her color scheme, the second level features a different
 background image than the first level.

Images and Sounds were sourced from OpemGameArt.org, see the Attributions file for
 specifics on how each image/sound clip was made availble, also attached are the liscenses of each
 image/sound clip.
